        <h1>SG Machia</h1>
        <h2>Multidisciplinary Artist</h2>

        <p>As an artist, I am trained primarily in oil painting and collage, but find myself drawn to digital media and traditional craft forms more than I am to paint. In all media, I am exploring the intersection of the physical world and the abstractions that make up identity.</p>
        <p>I believe in the power of the passionate maker to open doors of communication and to forge emotional connections. I love to work in a way that centers community and accessibility, and consider art and design work to be part of a larger practice of empathy, communication, and long-term connections.</p>
